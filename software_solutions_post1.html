    <hr style="color:black;">

      <article><p style="text-align: left;">To check your PC for viruses, you can follow the steps below:
<br><br>
        1. <b>Run a manual virus scan</b>: The best way to check your PC for viruses is to run a manual virus scan of your system with Microsoft Defender, Malwarebytes, or another antivirus program. You can also press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open the Task Manager and look for unusual processes using a lot of resources ¹.
        <br><br>
        2. <b>Check for signs of a virus</b>: Poor performance, application crashes, and computer freezes can sometimes be a sign of a virus or another type of malware wreaking havoc. However, that's not always the case: There are many other causes of problems that can slow down your PC. Likewise, just because your PC is running fine doesn't mean it doesn't have malware. The viruses of a decade ago were often pranks that ran wild and used a lot of system resources. Modern malware is more likely to lurk silently and covertly in the background, trying to evade detection so it can capture your credit card numbers and other personal information. In other words, modern-day malware is often created by criminals just to make money, and well-crafted malware won't cause any noticeable PC problems at all. Still, sudden poor PC performance may be one sign you have malware. Strange applications on your system may also indicate malware — but, once again, there's no guarantee malware is involved. Some applications pop up a Command Prompt window when they update, so strange windows flashing onto your screen and quickly disappearing may be a normal part of the legitimate software on your system. The only way to know for sure whether you have malware is to examine your system for it ¹.
