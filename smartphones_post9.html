        Dealing with a cracked screen on your tablet can be challenging, but there are steps you can take to address the issue. Here's a guide to help you navigate through this situation:
        <br>
        <br>
        1.<b> Assess the Damage:</b>
        Carefully examine the extent of the crack. If the screen is shattered or if the touchscreen is unresponsive, it may require professional repair.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. <b>Protect Your Fingers:</b>
        If the screen is cracked, there might be sharp edges. Be cautious when handling the tablet to avoid injuring yourself.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. <b>Backup Data:</b>
        If the tablet is still operational, back up your important data to avoid potential data loss.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. <b>Screen Protector (Temporary Solution):</b>
        If the crack is minor and doesn't affect the functionality of the tablet, consider applying a clear screen protector. This won't repair the damage but can help prevent further issues and protect your fingers.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. <b>Use a Stylus:</b>
        If the crack is affecting touchscreen functionality but still allows for some interaction, you might use a stylus as an alternative input method.
        <br>
        <br>
        6. <b>DIY Repair Kits (Caution):</b>

        Consider taking your tablet to a professional repair service or an authorized service center. They have the expertise and tools to replace the screen properly.
        <br>
        <br>
        9. <b>Check Insurance Coverage:</b>
