       <p style="text-align: left;">
        Slow performance in browser tabs can be caused by various factors. Here are steps you can take to address and improve the performance:
        <br>
        <br>
        1.<b>Close Unused Tabs:</b>
        
        Each open tab consumes system resources. Close tabs that you are not actively using to free up memory and processing power.
        <br>
        <br>
        2.<b>Use Extensions Wisely:</b>
        
        Some browser extensions can significantly impact performance. Disable or remove unnecessary extensions and only keep the ones you really need.
        <br>
        <br>
        3.<b>Update Your Browser:</b>
        
        Ensure that your browser is up to date. Developers frequently release updates that include performance improvements and bug fixes.
        <br>
        <br>
        4.<b>Clear Browser Cache and Cookies:</b>
        
        Cached data and cookies can accumulate over time and slow down your browser. Clearing them periodically can help improve performance. You can usually find this option in your browser settings.
        <br>
        <br>
        5.<b>Disable Hardware Acceleration:</b>
        
        Some users experience performance issues due to hardware acceleration. Try disabling it in your browser settings to see if it improves performance.
        <br>
        <br>
        6.<b>Check for Malware:</b>
        
        Malware can significantly impact system performance. Run a full system scan using your antivirus software to ensure your system is clean.
        <br>
        <br>
        7.<b>Reduce Number of Open Tabs:</b>
        
        Having too many open tabs can strain your system. Try to limit the number of open tabs, especially if you notice a slowdown.
        <br>
        <br>
        8.<b>Update Graphics Drivers:</b>
        
        Outdated graphics drivers can cause performance issues. Make sure your graphics drivers are up to date by visiting the website of your graphics card manufacturer.
        <br>
        <br>
        9.<b>Use a Lightweight Browser:</b>
        
        Consider using a browser known for its lightweight nature, such as Mozilla Firefox or Brave, if you find that your current browser is consistently slow.
        <br>
        <br>
        10.<b>Increase RAM:</b>
        
        If possible, consider upgrading your computer's RAM. More RAM can provide additional resources for your browser and improve overall performance.
        <br>
        <br>
       11.<b> Enable Lazy Loading:</b>
        
        Some browsers support lazy loading, which loads images and other content only when they come into the viewport. Enable this feature in your browser settings.
        <br>
        <br>
       12.<b> Experiment with Browser Flags:</b>
        
        Some browsers allow you to access experimental features by using flags. Be cautious with this, as these features are often in development, but it's worth exploring to see if any improvements can be made.
        <br>
        <br>
        13.<b>Optimize Web Pages:</b>
        
        Some websites may be poorly optimized and contribute to slow performance. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about this, but you can provide feedback to website developers if you notice specific sites causing issues.</p>
